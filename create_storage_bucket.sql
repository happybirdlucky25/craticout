-- Create storage bucket and policies for file uploads

-- 1. Create storage bucket for campaign documents

-- 2. Storage policies for campaign documents
-- Note: Temporarily allowing all access for development

-- Allow authenticated users to upload files
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Users can upload campaign documents"

WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'campaign-documents');

-- Allow users to view campaign documents

-- Allow users to delete campaign documents
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Users can delete campaign documents"
